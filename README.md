# LUMI Pachack - Satellite visualization tool

## Project Description
As part of the King's College London hackathon (Pachack), we have developed an interactive 3d visualisation tool for satellites and other celestial bodies. It displays the positions of the satellities over time, along with a short tail of their previous path. It also shows the path of the satellites from the perspective of stations on Earth. The satellites included are Envisat (now defunc) and Globalstar on 1st Jan 2020. The ground stations visualised in the animation are Graz and Herstmonceux.

## Running the script
To install the dependencies, type in a command line `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. Users can then run `python3 app.py`, which will print a link in the console. Copy and paste the link into a web brower to view the animation.

## How to use
Users can play rotate the 3d anaimation by using the tool "orbital rotation" on the top right corner. You can also zoom with the mouse wheel and acess the positions of the satellites by hovering over them with the mouse. Meanwhile, the ground view will be displyed on the right. Please note that data is available for some satellites and statations earlier than others.
